				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>Hi! I'm Lorenz Pepito, a Professional Dancer and a 5th Year Computer Engineering student from University Of Cebu-Main Campus. <br>
				   Recently I've been dedicating my time working hard and learning more from HTML5 and CSS3<br> 
				   which has been very effective as you can see on your screens right now. HTML5 and CSS3 is the one<br>
				   I used in coding this website, I was amazed on how broad the codes could get and definitely fell in love<br>
				   with it at the moment I saw how these codes works. Being a Software Engineer is what I really dreamed<br>
				   of since then and now that I am practicing jobs that Software Engineers gets, it really satisfies my heart's desire,<br>
				   that is why I've been honing my skills today for the benefit of the future me.
				   <br><br>
				   In this website you can view stuffs about me including dance videos where Im in or dance covers by me.<br>
				   You can also view projects created by me during my leisure time<br><br>
